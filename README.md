Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

    Node.js (Version 14 or higher) and npm (included with Node.js)
    Git for cloning the GitHub repository

Steps to Follow
1. Clone the GitHub repository

Use the git clone command to get the project from GitHub. Open your terminal and run the following command:
